Sheesh, what you sayin'? I don't understand
Goddamn, I'm out my mind, I popped another Xan
Sheesh, I swear this lock jaw got me stuttering
Goddamn, girl, you so fine, I'd fall in love again
Sheesh, gettin' faded is my favorite rush
Goddamn, you talkative, ain't gotta say too much
Be quiet, who got some grapes? I'm tryna roll some trees
Goddamn, uppers and downers, I'm off both of these
Gettin' faded, not complicated
Too sedated, no conversation
Gettin' faded, not complicated
We too sedated, no conversation
Please say less
Please say less
Please say less

[Pre-Hook: G-Eazy]
I'm blessed on blessed
I don't GAFOS
You tryna fuck?
Yes on yes on yes on yes
